*Registration and Login System, Using Python and Data Handling/Database/File Handling* 

Registration and login system Assignment/Task1 by GUVI-Greek Networks (an IIT-Madras incubated company)

We are supposed to build a Registration and Login System using python for the GUVI-Greek Networks on Python Tasks. 
We used python IDE for this purpose. According to our Assignment Question , we implemented the following features in the system.

Question/Task1:

Registration and Login system using Python, file handlingStage --
stage 1 >  Registration When the user chooses to Register---> email/username should have "@" and followed by "."      eg:- sherlock@gmail.com            nothing@yahoo.in---> it should not be like this        eg:- @gmail.com            there should not be any "." immediate next to "@"            eg:- my@.in            it should not start with special characters and numberseg:- 123#@gmail.com---> password (5 < password length > 16)              Must have minimum one special character,              one digit,              one uppercase,               one lowercase character 

Stage 2 >  Once the username and password are validated, store that data in a file

Stage 3 > Login When the user chooses to Login, check whether his/her credentials exist in the file or not based on the user input. If it doesn’t exist then ask them to go for Registration or If they have chosen forget password you should be able to retrieve their original password based on their username provided in the user inputor else you can ask them to provide a new password(only if their username matches with the data exists in the file)If nothing matches in your file you should ask them to Registration(Since they don't have an account)

Answer:
A Registration :
Any registrar can Create/Register using New Email ID/Username and password which is not in Database.After Registration they can login to the system using the Existing Email ID/username and password that was created by them while registering.

He can register for new credentials or see the data that his/her username is Correct or Not. 
if they want they can make proper changes to it if there are any errors. While Logging in.

Results We implemented the system using python and wrote commands to query the basic database/file.

Registrar Login:
Here, the registrar  logs in the system using the Email ID/Username and password provided by them while registering.
They can change passwordThey can create new account
They can check their password
They can Logout 
They can Exit from the login area


There will be further improvements in my project.If any.


*As of my knowledge, I tried, implemented the code with the help of References and completed my Task1.
